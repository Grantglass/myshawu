			<h1>About the Project</h1>
			<p><span class="tag-line">What does Shaw University look like through your eyes?</p>
			<p>Put your stamp on the college experience at Shaw and honor Shaw’s legacy by adding your viewpoint and story. It’s all about how you see it, and how you want others to see us. You are the creators and the photographers of our shared history in the making.</p>
      <p>This project seeks to document Shaw University student life, past and present, and is a collaborative project shared amongst students, faculty, and alumni. At http://myshawuniversity.com you can vote on your favorite #myshawu photos, see popular images, browse professor picks, and more. The Humanities department will work with the appropriate units on campus to preserve the #shaw150 photos in an archive so they become a permanent part of Shaw University history.</p>
      <h4>Removal of Images</h4>
      <p>Requesting that the photo be removed will remove it from the #shaw150 site and the university archives. If you have posted a photo that you would like removed simply send an email to Desiree Dighton, desireedighton@gmail.com, with your Instagram username and we will remove your images from our site and the university archives.</p>
      <h4>Terms of Use</h4>
      <p>Students and faculty are encouraged to contribute to #myshawu by tagging appropriate photos with the #myshawu, #shaw150, or #shawu150 hashtags.<p>
      <p>Popular images are determined by a combination of a photograph’s battle wins and the "likes" on the photograph. "Likes" on Instagram do not count towards the popularity score. "Likes" have to be submitted on the site to affect the popularity ranking.</p>
      <p>The photograph must obey all laws, including applicable copyright and privacy laws.</p>
